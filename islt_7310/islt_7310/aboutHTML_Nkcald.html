            <h3>From MLIS Student to Lbrarian</h3>
            <p>I am <strong>Doris Rogers</strong> and six years ago, I started working as a part-time substitute clerk in a small 
        community library.  Since that time, I have worked in public service, cataloging, and have written 
        several successful library technology grants.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal 
        Justice Administration and a Master of Public Administration.  <br>I am currently pursuing my Master of Library 
        and Information Science (MLIS) degree, without specialization, however, I plan to continue to work in 
        the <em>public library sector</em.  I will complete all requirements for graduation in December 2021.  Prior to 
        going to work at the library, I worked as a federal grants manager, training coordinator and in a 
        variety of administrative positions.  I am also a military veteran.  Around the time I began library 
        school, I came upon, what has now become on of my favorite quotes, <blockquote>"proceed as if success is 
        inevitable"</blockquote> by an unknown author and this has been my motto for the last two years.</p>
        <q>Onward and Upward!</q>
