             <p>I am Doris Rogers and six years ago, I started working as a part-time substitute clerk in a small community library.  
                   Since that time, I have worked in public service, cataloging, and have written several successful library technology grants.</p>

             <p>I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice Administration and a Master of Public Administration. I am currently 
                   pursuing my Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree, without specialization, however, I plan to continue to work in 
                   the public library sector. I will complete all requirements for graduation in <em>December 2021</em>.</p>

             <p>Prior to going to work at the library, I worked as a federal grants manager, training coordinator and in a 
                   variety of administrative positions. I am also a military veteran.<br>
