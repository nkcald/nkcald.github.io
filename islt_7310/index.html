            <p>Welcome to my ePortfolio webpage!  The workd displayed here are representative of some of
               my course work while studying at the University of Missouri, School of Information Science
               & Learning Technologies (SISLT).</p>

        <h2>Purpose, goals, and objective</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to display a collected sampling of the work that I have
               created during the course of my journey toward achieving my Master of Library and
               Information Science degree.  The competencies connected to the course work serve as 
               evidence of the depth and rigor of the program of study and the academic standards 
               required to be successful.  This website represents an opportunity to present my work 
               and the ability to recall the experiences of creating it. It is also an opportunity to
               connect the student and the professional to the accomplishments which have been achieved.
               It is my hope that the works displayed here are reflective of my understanding, 
               application and growth from the materials covered during the course of the program.
               The ability to present this ePortfolio of my work to a current or future employer 
               may be informative and valuable for  opportunities for growth, promotion or the ability
               to be competitive in the field.</p>
