        I retired from the University of Missouri â€“ Kansas City (UMKC) in December 2017.  Once fully retired from UMKC, I wanted to spend some time on determining what I wanted to do with my life.  I was working part-time at a small library and at that point had been working there for two years.   I was unsure if I wanted to pursue a fulltime position at the library or take some time to see what other opportunities were available in my community. I took some time to research opportunities in my community and responded with the requisite cover letters and resumes.  I really did not know what I wanted to do professionally, which made it difficult to focus on a particular area of employment. I thought I would continue work at the library for a time, until I could determine next steps. 
In June 2018, I began working fulltime at the library.  After about six months, I thought to myself, why not take this opportunity to go back to school and pursue a graduate degree in library science.  I thought about it for several more months and decided I would apply to the University of Missouri, School of Information Science and Learning Technologies.  It was at this point that I decided to talk to the library director to see if she thought I would be a good fit for the field and if she would write me a recommendation.  Honestly, I thought she would say no, since I had not worked in the library long and primarily only as a part-time substitute clerk. Once the director decided she could support my application for school, I thought, well now, I have to go through with this.  I begin to question my thinking, concerned about returning to school after years of not being in a classroom.  I applied to start at the University of Missouri, summer session, July 2019.  Once I was notified, I had been accepted, I told no one, and almost immediately regretted taking on this huge responsibility. I had no choice at this point but to move forward.   
Fast forward to August 2021.  Although I initially thought I would complete all my coursework and graduate the with Summer 2021 class, that did not happen.  I am on track to complete my coursework in time to graduate December 2021.  
The road to get to this time and place has been tough. Living during a global pandemic provided an unforeseen and an unknowable level of stress. The demands of home, work and school can be overwhelming at times. I feel fortunate for the support of my peers, those who are also in most cases, working, going to school and also have other demands.  The coursework is rigorous and the internal pressure to do well is constant. However, I am glad that I pushed through my regret and my fear of the unknown, to earn my Master of Library and Information Science MLIS) degree.  Although, I continue to work in the public library sector; however, after going through this program, I now know that there is an abundance of opportunities available to me as a MLIS graduate.
During the past two years, I have been blessed with the kindness, support and professionalism from all of the personnel I have met at the University of Missouri, particularly, the faculty and staff at the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies (SISLT).  Onward and Upward!
