            <h2>Hello Code Buddies</h2>
            <p>I am <strong>Doris Rogers</strong></p>While I find this class demanding, I am enjoying 
            a course I never thought I would take.  I enjoy the structure, the ability to work independently
            and the fact that we can reach out to classmates, which is a plus.</p>
