Hello World!  I am Doris Rogers, current Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) student, future administrative librarian.  Nearly six years ago, I started working as a part-time substitute clerk in a small community library.  I have since worked in public service, cataloging, and have written library technology grants.  I started my MLIS degree in July 2019 and will finish in December 2021.  I have prior work experience as a federal grants manager, training coordinator, and prior military service.  I do not have any previous web application or development training and experience.  I expect to gain a basic understanding and working knowledge of HTML and CSS, which will serve as a foundation for future growth.  If I had a favorite hobby, it would be sewing.  In my free time I like to watch episodes of “House Hunters” on the Home & Garden Television (HGTV) channel. 


<h2>Hello Code Buddies</h2>
<p>I am <strong>Doris Rogers</strong></p>While I find this class demanding, I am enjoying 
a course I never thought I would take.  I enjoy the structure, the ability to work independently
and the fact that we can reach out to classmates, which is a plus.</p>
